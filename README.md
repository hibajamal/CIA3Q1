# Value-Iteration-Simulation-Unity2D
Basic implementation of the deterministic Bellman equation for value iteration and the optimal path quest! Implemented with controllable hyperparameters on Unity2D.

Run the GridWorld.exe file inside the Gridworld folder to run the final simulation.

For implementation purposes: the implentation can be found in Assets/Scripts/Grid.cs
