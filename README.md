# Value-Iteration-Simulation-Unity2D
Basic implementation of the deterministic Bellman equation for value iteration and the optimal path quest! Implemented with controllable hyperparameters on Unity2D.

Run the Gridworld/GridWorld.exe file to run the final simulation.

For implementation purposes: see Assets/Scripts/Grid.cs and function ValueIteration(theta, discount).
